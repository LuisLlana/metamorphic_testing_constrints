\subsection{Program under study}
In order to test this novel approach to mutation and metamorphic
testing in constraint programming, we have chosen the program
\lstinline|rcpsp.mzn|, that is a standard version of
the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The
program is taken from the MiniZinc Benchmark
Suite~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks/blob/master/rcpsp/rcpsp.mzn}},
and we have included it in \ref{lst:minizinc-rcpsp}.

The inputs have been taken from the MiniZinc Challenge
2013~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks/tree/master/rcpsp/data_psplib}}. 
Due to the fact that the RCPSP is an NP-hard problem, we expect long computations on each sample. We initially took the all the samples from the
data set (J30, J60, J90, J120). 
The experiments were executed on an Intel Xeon W-2235 CPU at 3.80GHz with 6 cores (two threads per core). To take advantage of the multi-core system, we made a pool of processes to execute the maximum number of experiments in parallel. After a week of processing, only 2.32\% of the experiments were executed.
After this failed attempt, we decided to use the simplest
dataset (J30), where all inputs contain 30 tasks. Furthermore, we decided to set a timeout for each experiment. We initially set a 30-second timeout, which resulted in 18\% of experiments timing out. The execution of all experiments took 2 days. Finally, we set a 300-second timeout, which resulted in 16.92\% of experiments timing out. The total execution of all experiments took 28 days.
