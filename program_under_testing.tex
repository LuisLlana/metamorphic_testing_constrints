\subsection{Program under study}
In order to test this novel approach to mutation and metamorphic
testing in constraint programming, we have chosen a basic version of
the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The
program is taken from the MiniZinc Benchmark
Suite~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks/blob/master/rcpsp/rcpsp.mzn}},
and we have included it in Appendix~\ref{lst:minizinc-rcpsp}.

The inputs have been taken from the MiniZinc Challenge
2013~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks/tree/master/rcpsp/data_psplib}}. Due
to the duration of code execution, we have selected the simplest
dataset (J30), where all inputs contain 30 tasks.
