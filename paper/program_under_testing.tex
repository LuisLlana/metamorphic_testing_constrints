\subsection{Program under study}
We have chosen a basic version of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling
Problem (RCPSP). The program has been taken from The MiniZinc
Benchmark Suite~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks/blob/master/rcpsp/rcpsp.mzn}}
and we have included in the appendix~\ref{lst:minizinc-rcpsp}.
The inputs has been taken from the from the MiniZinc Challenge
2013~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks/tree/master/rcpsp/data_psplib}}. Due
the duration of the code execution he have taken the simplest dataset
(J30) where all the inputs have 30 tasks.
