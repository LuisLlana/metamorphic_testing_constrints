abstract = {We present a set of benchmark instances for the evaluation of solution procedures for single- and multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problems. The instances have been systematically generated by the standard project generator ProGen. They are characterized by the input-parameters of ProGen. The entire benchmark set including its detailed characterization and the best solutions known so-far are available on a public ftp-site. Hence, researchers can download the benchmark sets they need for the evaluation of their algorithms. Additionally, they can make available new results. Depending on the progress made in the field, the instance library will be continuously enlarged and new results will be made accessible. This should be a valuable and driving source for further improvements in the area of project type scheduling.}

Mutation is typically used as a way to evaluate the adequacy of test suites, to guide the generation of test cases, and to support experimentation. Mutation has reached a maturity phase and gradually gains popularity both in academia and in industry. This chapter presents a survey of recent advances, over the past decade, related to the fundamental problems of mutation testing and sets out the challenges and open problems for the future development of the method. It also collects advices on best practices related to the use of mutation in empirical studies of software testing. Thus, giving the reader a “mini-handbook”-style roadmap for the application of mutation testing as experimental methodology.}

In this paper we reveal that such studies are vulnerable to a potential threat to validity, leading to possible Type I errors; incorrectly rejecting the Null Hypothesis. Our findings indicate that Type I errors occur, for arbitrary experiments that fail to take countermeasures, approximately 62\% of the time. Clearly, a Type I error would potentially compromise any scientific conclusion. We show that the problem derives from such studies’ combined use of both subsuming and subsumed mutants. We collected articles published in the last two years at three leading software engineering conferences. Of those that use mutation-based test assessment, we found that 68\% are vulnerable to this threat to validity.},

Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that exploits the relationships among the inputs and outputs of multiple executions of the program under test, so- called Metamorphic Relations (MRs). MT has been proven highly effective in testing programs that face the oracle problem, for which the correctness of individual output is difficult to determine. Since the introduction of MT in 1998, the interest in this testing methodology has grown immensely with numerous applications in various domains such as machine learning, bioinformatics, computer graphics, simulation, search engines, decision support, cloud computing, databases, and compilers. The Second International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing (MET) will bring together researchers and practitioners in academia and industry to discuss research results and experiences in MT. The ultimate goal of MET is to provide a platform for the discussion of novel ideas, new perspectives, new applications, and state of research, related to or inspired by MT.},

abstract = {Context
Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) has been one of the popular approaches towards fault localization. It utilizes the execution result of failure or pass, and the corresponding coverage information (such as program slice) to estimate the risk of being faulty for each program entity (such as statement). However, all existing SBFL techniques assume the existence of a test oracle to determine the execution result of a test case. But, it is common that test oracles do not exist, and hence the applicability of SBFL has been severely restricted.
Objective
We aim at developing a framework that can extend the application of SBFL to the common situations where test oracles do not exist.
Method
Our approach uses a new concept of metamorphic slice resulting from the integration of metamorphic testing and program slicing. In SBFL, instead of using the program slice and the result of failure or pass for an individual test case, a metamorphic slice and the result of violation or non-violation of a metamorphic relation are used. Since we need not know the execution result for an individual test case, the existence of a test oracle is no longer a requirement to apply SBFL.
Results
An experimental study involving nine programs and three risk evaluation formulas was conducted. The results show that our proposed solution delivers a performance comparable to the performance observed by existing SBFL techniques for the situations where test oracles exist.
Conclusion
With respect to the problem that SBFL is only applicable to programs with test oracles, we propose an innovative solution. Our solution is not only intuitively appealing and conceptually feasible, but also practically effective. Consequently, test oracles are no longer mandatory for SBFL, and hence the applicability of SBFL is significantly extended.}

abstract = {The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) aims to schedule a set of activities subject to resource and precedence constraints to minimize the project makespan. The construction schedule optimization is modeled and solved as the RCPSP, and research on the RCPSP has had a positive impact on construction projects. However, given the narrow assumptions of the standard RCPSP model, it fails to capture many practical engineering requirements. Consequently, various extended problems and more competitive solutions have been developed. However, few studies have discussed the extensions of the RCPSP and corresponding optimization algorithms. This paper reviews the literature on project scheduling over the last decade. First, the standard RCPSP is described, and extended models are summarized based on objectives, constraints, and activities. Then, the research progress of the algorithm and other variants of the RCPSP are investigated. Finally, based on statistics obtained previously, current limitations, challenges, and future research directions are discussed.}

abstract = {The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a paradigmatic scheduling problem where the activities of a project have to be scheduled while respecting a combination of precedence and resource constraints. Precedence constraints are relations between two activities stating that one cannot start until the other has ended, and resource constraints bound the amount of resources used by activities running simultaneously. Many generalizations of the RCPSP have been proposed in the literature, including multiple execution modes for the activities (MRCPSP), or time varying resource availabilities and demands (RCPSP/t). In this work we present Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulations to solve the RCPSP, as well as its two variants MRCPSP and RCPSP/t. Although it is really natural to formulate resource constraints of RCPSP-like problems using the linear integer arithmetic (LIA) theory, we show how, by exploiting the information provided by the precedence relations, we can obtain compact and efficient encodings of resource constraints to Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formulas. Using these SAT encodings instead of the LIA ones, turns to be crucial regarding efficiency. The method is adapted to encode resource constraints for the other two considered variants. In this adaptation, the method exploits not only precedences, but multiple execution modes or time varying resource availabilities and demands. Our experimental results show that the proposed encodings are more efficient than existing state-of-the-art exact solving techniques for the studied problems.}

	abstract = {Mutation analysis generates tests that distinguish variations, or mutants, of an artifact from the original. Mutation analysis is widely considered to be a powerful approach to testing, and hence is often used to evaluate other test criteria in terms of mutation score, which is the fraction of mutants that are killed by a test set. But mutation analysis is also known to provide large numbers of redundant mutants, and these mutants can inflate the mutation score. While mutation approaches broadly characterized as reduced mutation try to eliminate redundant mutants, the literature lacks a theoretical result that articulates just how many mutants are needed in any given situation. Hence, there is, at present, no way to characterize the contribution of, for example, a particular approach to reduced mutation with respect to any theoretical minimal set of mutants. This paper's contribution is to provide such a theoretical foundation for mutant set minimization. The central theoretical result of the paper shows how to minimize efficiently mutant sets with respect to a set of test cases. We evaluate our method with a widely-used benchmark.},
