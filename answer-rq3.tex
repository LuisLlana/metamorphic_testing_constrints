\subsection{\rqidentifying: features of mutation-effective metamorphic relations}
The definition and explanation of the metamorphic rules are in
Section\ref{sec:def_MT}. In this section, we begin how each
metamorphic rule affects to each part or the \lstinline|rcpsp.mzn|
listed in~\ref{lst:minizinc-rcpsp}. The constraints of the programs
have been divided into 4 groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:precdence} Precedence constraints.
\item\label{item:redundant} Redundant non-overlapping constraints.
\item\label{item:cumulative} Cumulative resource constraints.
\item\label{item:makespan} Makespan constraints.
\end{enumerate}
The metamorphic rule \mr{1} only detects defects int the Precedence constratints
